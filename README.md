# restaurant-bill-generator
This is a C program that generates a bill for a customer based on the items and quantities they choose from a menu. The program reads the items and their prices from a file, asks the user for the customerâ€™s name and phone number, and calculates the total amount with a 10% discount and a 5% VAT. The program prints the bill in words and numbers.
